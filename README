===================

General Description:
This is an implementation of four knights puzzle for iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) using PhoneGap technology and KineticJS 
Javascript library.

How to play the game?
This puzzle is easy to play. The goal is to swap the positions of black knights with the white ones with minimum number 
of moves. Therefore, at the end the black knights should be placed on the bottom row (in corner squares) whereas the 
white ones on the top row (in corner squares). The knight move is similar to the regular chess where a knight can make 
an "L" shape move.
